               surface--atmosphere exchanges of energy, carbon dioxide and
               water vapour. The network of flux towers now encompasses ∼900
               sites, spread across every continent. Consequently, these data
               have become an essential benchmarking tool for land surface
               models (LSMs). However, these data as released are not
               immediately usable for driving, evaluating and benchmarking
               LSMs. Flux tower data must first be transformed into a
               LSM-readable file format, a process which involves changing
               units, screening missing data and varying degrees of additional
               gap-filling. All of this often leads to an under-utilisation of
               these data in model benchmarking. To resolve some of these
               issues, and to help make flux tower measurements more widely
               used, we present a reproducible, open-source R package that
               transforms the FLUXNET2015 and La Thuile data releases into

	abstract = {Land models, which have been developed by the modeling community
               in the past few decades to predict future states of ecosystems
               and climate, have to be critically evaluated for their
               performance skills of simulating ecosystem responses and
               feedback to climate change. Benchmarking is an emerging
               procedure to measure performance of models against a set of
               defined standards. This paper proposes a benchmarking framework
               for evaluation of land model performances and, meanwhile,
               highlights major challenges at this infant stage of benchmark
               analysis. The framework includes (1) targeted aspects of model
               performance to be evaluated, (2) a set of benchmarks as defined
               references to test model performance, (3) metrics to measure and
               compare performance skills among models so as to identify model
               strengths and deficiencies, and (4) model improvement. Land
               models are required to simulate exchange of water, energy,
               carbon and sometimes other trace gases between the atmosphere
               and land surface, and should be evaluated for their simulations
               of biophysical processes, biogeochemical cycles, and vegetation
               dynamics in response to climate change across broad temporal and
               spatial scales. Thus, one major challenge is to select and
               define a limited number of benchmarks to effectively evaluate
               land model performance. The second challenge is to develop
               metrics of measuring mismatches between models and benchmarks.
               The metrics may include (1) a priori thresholds of acceptable
               model performance and (2) a scoring system to combine
               data--model mismatches for various processes at different
               temporal and spatial scales. The benchmark analyses should
               identify clues of weak model performance to guide future
               development, thus enabling improved predictions of future states
               of ecosystems and climate. The near-future research effort
               should be on development of a set of widely acceptable
               benchmarks that can be used to objectively, effectively, and
               reliably evaluate fundamental properties of land models to
               improve their prediction performance skills.},

               evaluate the performance of three land surface models (LSMs)
               that are used in global climate models (GCMs). Predictions of
               the fluxes of sensible heat, latent heat, and net CO2 exchange
               obtained using process-based LSMs are benchmarked against two
               statistical models that only use incoming solar radiation, air
               temperature, and specific humidity as inputs to predict the
               fluxes. Both are then compared to measured fluxes at several
               flux stations located on three continents. Parameter sets used
               for the LSMs include default values used in GCMs for the plant
               functional type and soil type surrounding each flux station,
               locally calibrated values, and ensemble sets encompassing
               combinations of parameters within their respective uncertainty
               ranges. Performance of the LSMs is found to be generally
               inferior to that of the statistical models across a wide variety
               of performance metrics, suggesting that the LSMs underutilize
               the meteorological information used in their inputs and that
               model complexity may be hindering accurate prediction. The
               authors show that model evaluation is purpose specific; good
               performance in one metric does not guarantee good performance in
               others. Self-organizing maps are used to divide meteorological
               ??forcing space? into distinct regions as a mechanism to
               identify the conditions under which model bias is greatest.
               These new techniques will aid modelers to identify the areas of
               model structure responsible for poor performance.},

               (PLUMBER) was designed to be a land surface model (LSM)
               benchmarking intercomparison. Unlike the traditional methods of
               LSM evaluation or comparison, benchmarking uses a fundamentally
               different approach in that it sets expectations of performance
               in a range of metrics a priori?before model simulations are
               performed. This can lead to very different conclusions about LSM
               performance. For this study, both simple physically based models
               and empirical relationships were used as the benchmarks.
               Simulations were performed with 13 LSMs using atmospheric
               forcing for 20 sites, and then model performance relative to
               these benchmarks was examined. Results show that even for
               commonly used statistical metrics, the LSMs? performance varies
               considerably when compared to the different benchmarks. All
               models outperform the simple physically based benchmarks, but
               for sensible heat flux the LSMs are themselves outperformed by
               an out-of-sample linear regression against downward shortwave
               radiation. While moisture information is clearly central to
               latent heat flux prediction, the LSMs are still outperformed by
               a three-variable nonlinear regression that uses instantaneous
               atmospheric humidity and temperature in addition to downward
               shortwave radiation. These results highlight the limitations of
               the prevailing paradigm of LSM evaluation that simply compares
               an LSM to observations and to other LSMs without a mechanism to
               objectively quantify the expectations of performance. The
               authors conclude that their results challenge the conceptual

              Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS), a

              global sensitivity analysis. The study aims at examining
              potential model limitations, particularly with regard to
              long-term applications. A detailed sensitivity analysis based on
              variance decomposition is presented to investigate structural
              model assumptions and to highlight processes and parameters that
              cause the highest variability in the output. First- and
              total-order sensitivity indices were calculated for selected
              parameters using Sobol's methodology. In order to elucidate the
              role of climate on model sensitivity, different climate forcings
              were used based on observations from Switzerland. The results
              clearly indicate a very high sensitivity of LPJ-GUESS to
              photosynthetic parameters. Intrinsic quantum efficiency alone is
              able to explain about 60\% of the variability in vegetation
              carbon fluxes and pools for a wide range of climate forcings.
              Processes related to light harvesting were also found to be

               been incorporated into the land-surface parameterization scheme
               of the NCAR Community Climate Model after Dickinson. A
               stand-alone version of this land-surface scheme, termed the
               Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS), has been tested in
               a series of sensitivity experiments designed to assess the
               sensitivity of the scheme to the inclusion of variable soil
               characteristics. The cases investigated were for conditions
               designed to represent a low-latitude, evergreen forest; a
               low-latitude sand desert; a high-latitude coniferous forest;
               high-latitude tundra; and prairie grasslands, each for a
               specified time of year. The tundra included spring snowmelt and
               the grassland incorporated snow accumulation. The sensitivity
               experiments included varying the soil texture from a coarse
               texture typical of sand through a medium texture typical of loam
               to a fine texture typical of clay. The sensitivity of the
               formulation to the specified total and upper soil column depth
               and the response to altering the parameterization of the soil
               albedo dependence upon soil wetness and snow-cover were also
               examined. The biosphere-atmosphere transfer scheme showed the
               greatest sensitivity to the soil texture variation, particularly
               to the associated variation in the hydraulic conductivity and
               diffusivity parameters. There was only a very small response to
               the change in the soil albedo dependence on wetness and,
               although the sensitivity to the snow-covered soil albedo via the
               response to roughness length/snow-masking depth was significant,
               the results were predictable. Changing the total depth of the
               active soil column produced a much smaller response than
               altering the depth of the upper soil layer, primarily because
               the degree of saturation of the upper layer plays an important
               role in the parameterized hydrology. Soil moisture responses can
               also be initiated by changes in vegetation characteristics such
               as the stomatal resistance through changed canopy interaction
               which modify the radiation and water budgets of the soil
               surface. Overall, this land-surface parameterization scheme
               shows considerable sensitivity to the choice of soil texture.
               This sensitivity seems to be at least comparable to that
               involving changes in vegetation characteristics and it may be
               more important because soil characteristics are very poorly
               known at a resolution appropriate for global climate models.},

               Atmosphere Transfer Scheme, BATS) to its parameter values was
               investigated using a single column model. Identifying which
               parameters were important in controlling the turbulent energy
               fluxes, temperature, soil moisture, and runoff was dependent
               upon many factors. In the simulation of a nonmoisture-stressed
               tropical forest, results were dependent on a combination of
               reservoir terms (soil depth, root distribution), flux efficiency
               terms (roughness length, stomatal resistance), and available
               energy (albedo). If moisture became limited, the reservoir terms
               increased in importance because the total fluxes predicted
               depended on moisture availability and not on the rate of
               transfer between the surface and the atmosphere. The sensitivity
               shown by BATS depended on which vegetation type was being
               simulated, which variable was used to determine sensitivity, the
               magnitude and sign of the parameter change, the climate regime
               (precipitation amount and frequency), and soil moisture levels

               made it difficult to identify the most important parameters in

               of parameters is important in BATS, rather it shows that no
               general ranking of parameters is possible. It is also emphasized

              and climatology. The analysis employs visual ?feature-curve?
              representations to study the sensitivity of key model outputs to
              variations over a range of model parameters, atmospheric
              forcings, and model initialization conditions. The analysis
              provides insights into the behavior of the model and indicates
              that (1) the dominant energy flux shifts from being the soil
              sensible heat flux in arid/semiarid regions to evapotranspiration
              in rain forest regions; (2) in off-line studies the absence of
              important feedback mechanisms may result in unrealistic results
              at extreme climatic conditions; (3) the model functions which
              determine the atmosphere-controlled and soil moisture limited
              latent heat fluxes from soil and vegetation may need to be
              refined in order to obtain a more realistic modeling of the
              energy fluxes from the land surface; and (4) certain components
              of the model can possibly be simplified. The results also show
              that the influence of errors in the initial state estimates can
              persist for several years, indicating that caution should be
              exercised when attempting to validate or calibrate BATS using
              incomplete observation data and short-term simulation runs.},

	abstract = {Abstract The land surface is a key component of climate models.
               It controls the partitioning of available energy at the surface
               between sensible and latent heat, and it controls the
               partitioning of available water between evaporation and runoff.
               The land surface is also the location of the terrestrial carbon
               sink. Evidence is increasing that the influence of the land
               surface is significant on climate and that changes in the land
               surface can influence regional- to global-scale climate on time
               scales from days to millennia. Further, there is now a
               suggestion that the terrestrial carbon sink may decrease as
               global temperatures increase as a consequence of rising CO2
               levels. This paper provides the theoretical background that
               explains why the land surface should play a central role in
               climate. It also provides evidence, sourced from climate model
               experiments, that the land surface is of central importance.
               This paper then reviews the development of land surface models
               designed for climate models from the early, very simple models
               through to recent efforts, which include a coupling of
               biophysical processes to represent carbon exchange. It is
               pointed out that significant problems remain to be addressed,
               including the difficulties in parameterizing hydrological
               processes, root processes, sub-grid-scale heterogeneity and
               biogeochemical cycles. It is argued that continued development
               of land surface models requires more multidisciplinary efforts
               by scientists with a wide range of skills. However, it is also
               argued that the framework is now in place within the
               international community to build and maintain the latest
               generation of land surface models. Further, there should be
               considerable optimism that consolidating the recent rapid
               advances in land surface modelling will enhance our capability
               to simulate the impacts of land-cover change and the impacts of
               increasing CO2 on the global and regional environment. Copyright

               the simultaneous transfer of CO2 and water vapor into and out of
               the vegetation, respectively; (ii) use of satellite data, as

              dynamics can be represented in a single, physically consistent

              biophysical, physiological, and ecological processes, the model
              is designed around a hierarchical, modular structure and uses a
              common state description throughout. First, a coupled simulation
              of the surface water, energy, and carbon fluxes is performed on
              hourly timesteps and is integrated over the year to estimate the
              annual water and carbon balance. Next, the annual carbon balance
              is used to predict changes in the leaf area index and biomass for
              each of nine plant functional types, which compete for light and
              water using different ecological strategies. The resulting
              patterns of annual evapotranspiration, runoff, and net primary

	abstract = {Current land surface models use increasingly complex
               descriptions of the processes that they represent. Increase in
               complexity is accompanied by an increase in the number of model
               parameters, many of which cannot be measured directly at large
               spatial scales. A Monte Carlo framework was used to evaluate the
               sensitivity and identifiability of ten parameters controlling
               surface and subsurface runoff generation in the Variable
               Infiltration Capacity model (VIC). Using the Monte Carlo
               Analysis Toolbox (MCAT), parameter sensitivities were studied
               for four U.S. watersheds along a hydroclimatic gradient, based
               on a 20-year data set developed for the Model Parameter
               Estimation Experiment (MOPEX). Results showed that simulated
               streamflows are sensitive to three parameters when evaluated
               with different objective functions. Sensitivity of the
               infiltration parameter (b) and the drainage parameter (exp) were
               strongly related to the hydroclimatic gradient. The placement of
               vegetation roots played an important role in the sensitivity of
               model simulations to the thickness of the second soil layer
               (thick2). Overparameterization was found in the base flow
               formulation indicating that a simplified version could be
               implemented. Parameter sensitivity was more strongly dictated by
               climatic gradients than by changes in soil properties. Results
               showed how a complex model can be reduced to a more parsimonious
               form, leading to a more identifiable model with an increased
               chance of successful regionalization to ungauged basins.
               Although parameter sensitivities are strictly valid for VIC,
               this model is representative of a wider class of macroscale
               hydrological models. Consequently, the results and methodology
               will have applicability to other hydrological models.},

               improve the representation of the surface forcing from
               heterogeneous land in atmospheric models. With this approach,
               land-surface characteristics are prescribed by probability
               density functions (PDFs) rather than single ?representative?
               values as in ?big-leaf? parameterizations. Yet the use of many
               PDFs results in an increased computational burden and requires
               the complex problem of representing covariances between PDFs to
               be addressed. In this study, a sensitivity analysis of a
               land-surface parameterization for atmospheric modeling was
               performed to evaluate the surface parameters most important to
               the variability of surface heat fluxes. The Fourier amplitude

               relative contribution of individual input parameters to the
               variance of energy fluxes resulting from a heterogeneous
               surface. By simultaneously varying all parameters according to
               their individual probability density functions, the number of
               computations needed is very much reduced by this technique. This
               analysis demonstrates that most of the variability of surface
               heat fluxes may be described by the distributions of relative
               stomatal conductance and surface roughness. Thus, the
               statistical-dynamical approach may be simplified by the use of
               only these two probability density functions.},

	abstract = {Abstract The discharge of freshwater into oceans represents a
               fundamental process in the global climate system, and this flux
               is taken into account in simulations with general circulation
               models (GCMs). Moreover, the availability of realistic river
               routing schemes is a powerful instrument to assess the validity
               of land surface components, which have been recognized to be
               crucial for the global climate simulation. In this study,
               surface and subsurface runoff generated by the 13 land surface
               schemes (LSSs) participating in the Second Global Soil Wetness
               Project (GSWP-2) are used as input fields for the Hydrology
               Discharge (HD) routing model to simulate discharge for 30 of the
               world?s largest rivers. The simplest land surface models do not
               provide a good representation of runoff, and routed river flows
               using these inputs are affected by many biases. On the other
               hand, HD shows the best simulations when forced by two of the
               more sophisticated schemes. The multimodel ensemble GSWP-2
               generates the best phasing of the annual cycle as well as a good
               representation of absolute values, although the ensemble mean
               tends to smooth the peaks. Finally, the intermodel comparison
               shows the limits and deficiencies of a velocity-constant routing
               model such as HD, particularly in the phase of mean annual
               discharge. The second part of the study assesses the sensitivity
               of river discharge to the variation of external meteorological
               forcing. The Center for Ocean?Land?Atmosphere Studies version of
               the SSiB model is constrained with different meteorological
               fields and the resulting runoff is used as input for HD. River
               flow is most sensitive to precipitation variability, but changes
               in radiative forcing affect discharge as well, presumably
               because of the interaction with evaporation. Also, this analysis
               provides an estimate of the sensitivity of river discharge to
               precipitation variations. A few areas (e.g., central and eastern
               Asia, the Mediterranean, and much of the United States) show a
               magnified response of river discharge to a given percentage
               change in precipitation. Hence, an amplified effect of droughts
               as indicated by the consensus of climate change predictions may
               occur in places such as the Mediterranean. Conversely,
               increasing summer precipitation foreseen in places like southern
               and eastern Asia may amplify floods in these poor and heavily
               populated regions. Globally, a 1\% fluctuation in precipitation
               forcing results in an average 2.3\% change in discharge. These
               results can be used for the definition and assessment of new
               strategies for land use and water management in the near future.},

               constitutes a key tool for investigation of the global carbon
               cycle, which has lead to the recent development of numerous
               terrestrial biosphere models. However, as demonstrated by recent
               intercomparison studies, results of plant carbon uptake,
               expressed as net primary productivity (NPP), still diverge to a
               large degree. Here, we address the question of uncertainty by
               conducting a series of sensitivity tests with a single,
               process-based model, the Biosphere Energy-Transfer Hydrology
               (BETHY) scheme. We calculate NPP globally for a standard model
               setup and various alternative model setups representing either
               changes in modeling strategy or approximate uncertainties of the
               most important model parameters. The results show that estimated
               uncertainties of many process parameters are still too large for
               reliable predictions of global NPP. The largest uncertainties
               come from plant respiration, photosynthesis and soil water
               storage. The surface radiation balance and day-to-day variations
               in weather, often not included into terrestrial vegetation
               models, are also found to contribute significantly to overall
               uncertainties, while stomatal behavior, the aerodynamic coupling
               of vegetation and atmosphere, and the choice of the vegetation
               map turn out to be relatively unimportant. A further comparison
               with field measurements of NPP suggests that such data are too
               unreliable for validating biosphere model predictions. We
               conclude that the inherent uncertainties in process-oriented
               biosphere modeling are able to explain the discrepancies that
               have occurred when comparing the results of different models.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art global land surface models (LSMs) have a large
               number (i.e. a few hundred) of parameters. Many of those
               parameters are poorly constrained and are therefore very
               uncertain. Usually only a few of the parameters are responsible
               for changes in the model output of interest. Identifying those
               parameters that have a significant effect on the model output is
               an important step before applying parameter estimation methods
               using observations. However this has not been done
               systematically for any global LSMs yet, because of the
               computational costs involved. Here, we introduce a global
               sensitivity analysis method that is widely used in chemical
               engineering. This method includes two steps: a screening step
               that ranks all model parameters by their importance on model
               output in order to select the potentially important parameters
               and a second step that aims to quantify the contribution to the
               variance of model output by each of the pre-selected parameters
               and by their interactions. This method can be readily applied to
               any model. Here we apply this method to the Australian community
               land surface model (CABLE) as an example, and find that the
               two-step approach is efficient as only 690 model simulations are
               required to identify the few important parameters amongst the 22
               parameters for each of the 10 plant functional types (PFTs) in
               the first step. Another 256 model simulations are required for
               the variance based analysis in the second step. We find that the
               leaf maximum carboxylation rate (vcmax) is by far the most
               important parameter for global annual gross primary productivity
               (GPP) across all PFTs. However, if focusing on annual latent
               heat flux (LE) the importance of the parameters is very much PFT
               dependent. We suggest that this two-step approach should be used
               to identify important parameters in global LSMs, so that
               observations to constrain parameters can be used more
               efficiently in a subsequent parameter estimation step.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Human land-use activities have resulted in large
               changes to the Earth's surface, with resulting implications for
               climate. In the future, land-use activities are likely to expand
               and intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber,
               and energy. The Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP)
               aims to further advance understanding of the impacts of land-use
               and land-cover change (LULCC) on climate, specifically
               addressing the following questions. (1) What are the effects of
               LULCC on climate and biogeochemical cycling (past--future)? (2)
               What are the impacts of land management on surface fluxes of
               carbon, water, and energy, and are there regional
               land-management strategies with the promise to help mitigate
               climate change? In addressing these questions, LUMIP will also
               address a range of more detailed science questions to get at
               process-level attribution, uncertainty, data requirements, and
               other related issues in more depth and sophistication than
               possible in a multi-model context to date. There will be
               particular focus on the separation and quantification of the
               effects on climate from LULCC relative to all forcings,
               separation of biogeochemical from biogeophysical effects of land
               use, the unique impacts of land-cover change vs. land-management
               change, modulation of land-use impact on climate by
               land--atmosphere coupling strength, and the extent to which
               impacts of enhanced CO2 concentrations on plant photosynthesis
               are modulated by past and future land use.LUMIP involves three
               major sets of science activities: (1) development of an updated
               and expanded historical and future land-use data set, (2) an
               experimental protocol for specific LUMIP experiments for CMIP6,
               and (3) definition of metrics and diagnostic protocols that
               quantify model performance, and related sensitivities, with
               respect to LULCC. In this paper, we describe LUMIP activity (2),
               i.e., the LUMIP simulations that will formally be part of CMIP6.
               These experiments are explicitly designed to be complementary to
               simulations requested in the CMIP6 DECK and historical
               simulations and other CMIP6 MIPs including ScenarioMIP, C4MIP,
               LS3MIP, and DAMIP. LUMIP includes a two-phase experimental
               design. Phase one features idealized coupled and land-only model
               simulations designed to advance process-level understanding of
               LULCC impacts on climate, as well as to quantify model
               sensitivity to potential land-cover and land-use change. Phase
               two experiments focus on quantification of the historic impact
               of land use and the potential for future land management
               decisions to aid in mitigation of climate change. This paper
               documents these simulations in detail, explains their rationale,
               outlines plans for analysis, and describes a new subgrid
               land-use tile data request for selected variables (reporting
               model output data separately for primary and secondary land,
               crops, pasture, and urban land-use types). It is essential that
               modeling groups participating in LUMIP adhere to the
               experimental design as closely as possible and clearly report
               how the model experiments were executed.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM) is the
               interactive vegetation component in the Earth system model of
               the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis. CTEM
               models land--atmosphere exchange of CO2 through the response of
               carbon in living vegetation, and dead litter and soil pools, to
               changes in weather and climate at timescales of days to
               centuries. Version 1.0 of CTEM uses prescribed fractional
               coverage of plant functional types (PFTs) although, in reality,
               vegetation cover continually adapts to changes in climate,
               atmospheric composition and anthropogenic forcing. Changes in
               the spatial distribution of vegetation occur on timescales of
               years to centuries as vegetation distributions inherently have
               inertia. Here, we present version 2.0 of CTEM, which includes a
               representation of competition between PFTs based on a modified
               version of the Lotka--Volterra (L--V) predator--prey equations.
               Our approach is used to dynamically simulate the fractional
               coverage of CTEM's seven natural, non-crop PFTs, which are then
               compared with available observation-based estimates. Results
               from CTEM v. 2.0 show the model is able to represent the broad
               spatial distributions of its seven PFTs at the global scale.
               However, differences remain between modelled and
               observation-based fractional coverage of PFTs since representing
               the multitude of plant species globally, with just seven
               non-crop PFTs, only captures the large-scale climatic controls
               on PFT distributions. As expected, PFTs that exist in climate
               niches are difficult to represent either due to the coarse
               spatial resolution of the model, and the corresponding driving
               climate, or the limited number of PFTs used. We also simulate
               the fractional coverage of PFTs using unmodified L--V equations
               to illustrate its limitations. The geographic and zonal
               distributions of primary terrestrial carbon pools and fluxes
               from the versions of CTEM that use prescribed and dynamically
               simulated fractional coverage of PFTs compare reasonably well
               with each other and observation-based estimates. The
               parametrization of competition between PFTs in CTEM v. 2.0 based
               on the modified L--V equations behaves in a reasonably realistic
               manner and yields a tool with which to investigate the changes
               in spatial distribution of vegetation in response to future
               changes in climate.},

               of forests on three continents, encompassing all tropical
               forests, for the early 2000s, which will be invaluable for REDD
               assessments at both project and national scales. We mapped the
               total carbon stock in live biomass (above- and belowground),
               using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots
               and satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) samples of
               forest structure to estimate carbon storage, plus optical and
               microwave imagery (1-km resolution) to extrapolate over the
               landscape. The total biomass carbon stock of forests in the
               study region is estimated to be 247 Gt C, with 193 Gt C stored
               aboveground and 54 Gt C stored belowground in roots. Forests in
               Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia accounted
               for 49\%, 25\%, and 26\% of the total stock, respectively. By
               analyzing the errors propagated through the estimation process,
               uncertainty at the pixel level (100 ha) ranged from $\pm$ 6\% to
               $\pm$ 53\%, but was constrained at the typical project (10,000

	abstract = {Global warming and the rise in atmospheric CO(2) will increase
               the operating temperature of leaves in coming decades, often
               well above the thermal optimum for photosynthesis. Presently,
               there is controversy over the limiting processes controlling
               photosynthesis at elevated temperature. Leading models propose
               that the reduction in photosynthesis at elevated temperature is
               a function of either declining capacity of electron transport to
               regenerate RuBP, or reductions in the capacity of Rubisco
               activase to maintain Rubisco in an active configuration.
               Identifying which of these processes is the principal limitation
               at elevated temperature is complicated because each may be
               regulated in response to a limitation in the other. Biochemical
               and gas exchange assessments can disentangle these
               photosynthetic limitations; however, comprehensive assessments
               are often difficult and, for many species, virtually impossible.
               It is proposed that measurement of the initial slope of the
               CO(2) response of photosynthesis (the A/C(i) response) can be a
               useful means to screen for Rubisco activase limitations. This is
               because a reduction in the Rubisco activation state should be
               most apparent at low CO(2) when Rubisco capacity is generally
               limiting. In sweet potato, spinach, and tobacco, the initial
               slope of the A/C(i) response shows no evidence of activase
               limitations at high temperature, as the slope can be accurately
               modelled using the kinetic parameters of fully activated
               Rubisco. In black spruce (Picea mariana), a reduction in the
               initial slope above 30 degrees C cannot be explained by the
               known kinetics of fully activated Rubisco, indicating that
               activase may be limiting at high temperatures. Because black
               spruce is the dominant species in the boreal forest of North
               America, Rubisco activase may be an unusually important factor
               determining the response of the boreal biome to climate change.},

               currently used to evaporate water. Climate change is expected to
               intensify the hydrological cycle and to alter
               evapotranspiration, with implications for ecosystem services and
               feedback to regional and global climate. Evapotranspiration
               changes may already be under way, but direct observational
               constraints are lacking at the global scale. Until such evidence
               is available, changes in the water cycle on land−a key
               diagnostic criterion of the effects of climate change and
               variability−remain uncertain. Here we provide a data-driven
               estimate of global land evapotranspiration from 1982 to 2008,
               compiled using a global monitoring network, meteorological and
               remote-sensing observations, and a machine-learning algorithm.
               In addition, we have assessed evapotranspiration variations over
               the same time period using an ensemble of process-based
               land-surface models. Our results suggest that global annual
               evapotranspiration increased on average by 7.1 $\pm$ 1.0
               millimetres per year per decade from 1982 to 1997. After that,
               coincident with the last major El Ni{\~n}o event in 1998, the
               global evapotranspiration increase seems to have ceased until
               2008. This change was driven primarily by moisture limitation in
               the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Africa and Australia. In
               these regions, microwave satellite observations indicate that
               soil moisture decreased from 1998 to 2008. Hence, increasing
               soil-moisture limitations on evapotranspiration largely explain
               the recent decline of the global land-evapotranspiration trend.
               Whether the changing behaviour of evapotranspiration is
               representative of natural climate variability or reflects a more
               permanent reorganization of the land water cycle is a key

               Abstract: Long term, high quality estimates of burned area are
               needed for improving both prognostic and diagnostic fire
               emissions models and for assessing feedbacks between fire and
               the climate system. We developed global, monthly burned area
               estimates aggregated to 0.5° spatial resolution for the time
               period July 1996 through mid-2009 using four satellite data
               sets. From 2001--2009, our primary data source was 500-m burned
               area maps produced using Moderate Resolution Imaging
               Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance imagery; more than
               90\% of the global area burned during this time period was
               mapped in this fashion. During times when the 500-m MODIS data
               were not available, we used a combination of local regression
               and regional regression trees developed over periods when burned
               area and Terra MODIS active fire data were available to
               indirectly estimate burned area. Cross-calibration with fire
               observations from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)
               Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) and the Along-Track Scanning
               Radiometer (ATSR) allowed the data set to be extended prior to
               the MODIS era. With our data set we estimated that the global
               annual area burned for the years 1997--2008 varied between 330
               and 431 Mha, with the maximum occurring in 1998. We compared our
               data set to the recent GFED2, L3JRC, GLOBCARBON, and MODIS
               MCD45A1 global burned area products and found substantial
               differences in many regions. Lastly, we assessed the interannual
               variability and long-term trends in global burned area over the
               past 13 years. This burned area time series serves as the basis
               for the third version of the Global Fire Emissions Database

               Abstract: Stocks of soil organic carbon represent a large
               component of the carbon cycle that may participate in climate
               change feedbacks, particularly on decadal and centennial
               timescales. For Earth system models (ESMs), the ability to
               accurately represent the global distribution of existing soil
               carbon stocks is a prerequisite for accurately predicting future
               carbon--climate feedbacks. We compared soil carbon simulations
               from 11 model centers to empirical data from the Harmonized
               World Soil Database (HWSD) and the Northern Circumpolar Soil
               Carbon Database (NCSCD). Model estimates of global soil carbon
               stocks ranged from 510 to 3040 Pg C, compared to an estimate of
               1260 Pg C (with a 95\% confidence interval of 890--1660 Pg C)
               from the HWSD. Model simulations for the high northern latitudes
               fell between 60 and 820 Pg C, compared to 500 Pg C (with a 95\%
               confidence interval of 380--620 Pg C) for the NCSCD and 290 Pg C
               for the HWSD. Global soil carbon varied 5.9 fold across models
               in response to a 2.6-fold variation in global net primary
               productivity (NPP) and a 3.6-fold variation in global soil
               carbon turnover times. Model--data agreement was moderate at the
               biome level (R2 values ranged from 0.38 to 0.97 with a mean of
               0.75); however, the spatial distribution of soil carbon
               simulated by the ESMs at the 1° scale was not well correlated
               with the HWSD (Pearson correlation coefficients less than 0.4
               and root mean square errors from 9.4 to 20.8 kg C m−2). In
               northern latitudes where the two data sets overlapped, agreement
               between the HWSD and the NCSCD was poor (Pearson correlation
               coefficient 0.33), indicating uncertainty in empirical estimates
               of soil carbon. We found that a reduced complexity model
               dependent on NPP and soil temperature explained much of the 1°
               spatial variation in soil carbon within most ESMs (R2 values
               between 0.62 and 0.93 for 9 of 11 model centers). However, the
               same reduced complexity model only explained 10\% of the spatial
               variation in HWSD soil carbon when driven by observations of NPP
               and temperature, implying that other drivers or processes may be
               more important in explaining observed soil carbon distributions.
               The reduced complexity model also showed that differences in
               simulated soil carbon across ESMs were driven by differences in
               simulated NPP and the parameterization of soil heterotrophic
               respiration (inter-model R2 = 0.93), not by structural
               differences between the models. Overall, our results suggest
               that despite fair global-scale agreement with observational data
               and moderate agreement at the biome scale, most ESMs cannot
               reproduce grid-scale variation in soil carbon and may be missing
               key processes. Future work should focus on improving the
               simulation of driving variables for soil carbon stocks and
               modifying model structures to include additional processes.},

               satellite-retrieved surface, cloud, and aerosol properties as

               example, from the Clouds and the Earth?s Radiant Energy System
               (CERES). This paper presents a method to determine surface
               irradiances using observational constraints of TOA irradiance
               from CERES. A Lagrange multiplier procedure is used to
               objectively adjust inputs based on their uncertainties such that
               the computed TOA irradiance is consistent with CERES-derived
               irradiance to within the uncertainty. These input adjustments
               are then used to determine surface irradiance adjustments.
               Observations by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS),
               Cloud?Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite
               Observations (CALIPSO), CloudSat, and Moderate Resolution

               A-Train constellation provide the uncertainty estimates. A
               comparison with surface observations from a number of sites

               computed and observed monthly mean irradiances calculated with
               10 years of data is 4.7 (13.3) W m?2 for downward shortwave and
               ?2.5 (7.1) W m?2 for downward longwave irradiances over ocean
               and ?1.7 (7.8) W m?2 for downward shortwave and ?1.0 (7.6) W m?2
               for downward longwave irradiances over land. The bias and RMS
               error for the downward longwave and shortwave irradiances over

               the bias and RMS error for downward longwave over land improves,

               satellite retrievals, land surface assimilation systems,
               physical snow models, and reanalyses. While the climatologies of
               total Northern Hemisphere snow water mass (SWM) vary among the
               datasets by as much as 50\%, their interannual variability and
               daily anomalies are comparable, showing moderate to good
               temporal correlations (between 0.60 and 0.85) on both
               interannual and intraseasonal time scales. Wintertime trends of
               total Northern Hemisphere SWM are consistently negative over the
               1981?2010 period among the five datasets but vary in strength by
               a factor of 2?3. Examining spatial patterns of SWE indicates
               that the datasets are most consistent with one another over
               boreal forest regions compared to Arctic and alpine regions.
               Additionally, the datasets derived using relatively recent
               reanalyses are strongly correlated with one another and show
               better correlations with the satellite product [the European
               Space Agency (ESA)?s Global Snow Monitoring for Climate Research
               (GlobSnow)] than do those using older reanalyses. Finally, a
               comparison of eight reanalysis datasets over the 2001?10 period
               shows that land surface model differences control the majority
               of spread in the climatological value of SWM, while
               meteorological forcing differences control the majority of the
               spread in temporal correlations of SWM anomalies.},

@article{Dai2002-tp,
	abstract = {Abstract Annual and monthly mean values of continental
               freshwater discharge into the oceans are estimated at 1°
               resolution using several methods. The most accurate estimate is
               based on streamflow data from the world's largest 921 rivers,
               supplemented with estimates of discharge from unmonitored areas
               based on the ratios of runoff and drainage area between the
               unmonitored and monitored regions. Simulations using a river
               transport model (RTM) forced by a runoff field were used to
               derive the river mouth outflow from the farthest downstream
               gauge records. Separate estimates are also made using RTM
               simulations forced by three different runoff fields: 1) based on
               observed streamflow and a water balance model, and from
               estimates of precipitation P minus evaporation E computed as
               residuals from the atmospheric moisture budget using atmospheric
               reanalyses from 2) the National Centers for Environmental
               Prediction?National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP?NCAR)
               and 3) the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
               (ECMWF). Compared with previous estimates, improvements are made
               in extending observed discharge downstream to the river mouth,
               in accounting for the unmonitored streamflow, in discharging
               runoff at correct locations, and in providing an annual cycle of
               continental discharge. The use of river mouth outflow increases
               the global continental discharge by ?19\% compared with
               unadjusted streamflow from the farthest downstream stations. The
               river-based estimate of global continental discharge presented
               here is 37?288 $\pm$ 662 km3 yr?1, which is ?7.6\% of global P
               or 35\% of terrestrial P. While this number is comparable to
               earlier estimates, its partitioning into individual oceans and
               its latitudinal distribution differ from earlier studies. The
               peak discharges into the Arctic, the Pacific, and global oceans
               occur in June, versus May for the Atlantic and August for the
               Indian Oceans. Snow accumulation and melt are shown to have
               large effects on the annual cycle of discharge into all ocean
               basins except for the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean and
               Black Seas. The discharge and its latitudinal distribution
               implied by the observation-based runoff and the ECMWF
               reanalysis-based P?E agree well with the river-based estimates,
               whereas the discharge implied by the NCEP?NCAR reanalysis-based
               P?E has a negative bias.},
